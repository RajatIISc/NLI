# NLI

The Preprocess.py file preprocesses the data and save it in a csv file in an easily readable format.
To create the sentence encoder embeddings, the files needed to be run are named as create####.py.
Note that the above files will be needing fasttext word embeddings to create sentence encoder embeddings.
Deep_model_training.py trains the neural network model for the classification task and saves the model in models folder
Deep_model_testing.py is used to to load the saved model and run it on the test data.
Two generated output files have been saved with the specific file names as given in the assignment.
If you have any doubts regarding the logistics of the repo, I am available at rajatnagpal@iisc.ac.in
